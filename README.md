Domain FMCG
Project overview & Problem statement 
AtliQ Mart (an imaginary retail giant) with over 50 supermarkets in southern region of India, ran a massive promotion during Diwali 2023 and Sankranthi 2024 ( festive time in India ) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales Director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.
Now the company wants insights for 10 ad hoc / business requests.
